Pynbody Tutorials
=================

Here you will find tutorials that illustrate the use of pynbody. The
:ref:`walkthroughs` demonstrate pynbody functionality through an
interactive session in the ipython shell that you can follow along
using either one of the outputs from the bundled test-data or one of
your own simulations. To complement the walkthroughs, we also provide
a few `IPython notebooks
<https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody/tree/master/examples/notebooks>`_. The
:ref:`cookbook` tutorials are more goal-oriented: they provide a
script that can be used with only minor modifications to immediately
produce a result (i.e. make an image). They also include, however, a
somewhat more involved discussion of more advanced options and common
pitfalls. Finally, the :ref:`advanced_topics` section is meant to
provide a more in-depth look at the inner-workings of the code.
