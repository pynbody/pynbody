=======

[Pynbody](https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody) is a light-weight,
portable, format-transparent analysis framework for N-body and
hydrodynamic astrophysical simulations supporting PKDGRAV/Gasoline,
Gadget, N-Chilada, and RAMSES AMR outputs.

Written in python, the core tools are accompanied by a library of
publication-level analysis routines.

### Getting started 

If your python with distutils is installd and properly configured, you can simply do:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody
$ cd pynbody
$ python setup.py install
$ python
>>> import pynbody
```

If this fails, you may need some more detailed [installation
instructions](http://pynbody.github.io/pynbody/installation.html). Once
you have the package instlaled, try the introductory
