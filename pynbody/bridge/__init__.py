bridge
======

The bridge module has tools for connecting different outputs. For instance,
it's possible to take a subview (e.g. a halo) from one snapshot and 'push'
it into the other. This is especially useful if the two snapshots are
different time outputs of the same simulation.

Once connected, bridge called on a specific subset of particles in
output1 will trace these particles back (or forward) to the output2,
enabling observing a change in their properties, such as position,
temperature, etc.

For a tutorial on how to use the bridge module to trace the particles
in your simulation, see the `bridge tutorial
<http://pynbody.github.io/pynbody/tutorials/bridge.html>`_.

        Bridge object connecting the two parent simulations, this identifies
        the most likely ID's in groups_2 of the objects specified in groups_1.

        If groups_1 and groups_2 are not specified, they are automatically obtained
        using the SimSnap.halos method.

        Parameters min_index and max_index are the minimum and maximum halo
        numbers to be matched (in both ends of the bridge). If max_index is
        too large, the catalogue matching can take prohibitively long (it
        scales as max_index^2).

        This routine currently uses particle number as a proxy for mass, so that the
        main simulation data does not need to be loaded.

        If b links snapshot f1 (high redshift) to f2 (low redshift) and we set

          cat = b.match_catalog()

        then cat is now a numpy index array such that f1.halos()[i] is the
        major progenitor for f2.halos()[cat[i]], assuming cat[i] is positive.

        cat[0:min_index+1] is set to -2. Halos which cannot be matched because
        they have too few particles in common give the result -1. This is determined
        by the given threshold fraction of particles in common (by default, 50%).

        If use_family is specified, only particles from that family are cross-matched.
        This can be useful e.g. if matching between two different simulations where
        the relationship between DM particles is known, but perhaps the relationship
        between star particles is random.
