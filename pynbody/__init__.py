# The PlotModuleProxy serves to delay import of pynbody.plot until it's accessed.
# Importing pynbody.plot imports pylab which in turn is quite slow and cause problem
# for terminal-only applications. However, since pynbody always auto-imported
# pynbody.plot, it would seem to be too destructive to stop this behaviour.
# So this hack is the compromise and should be completely transparent to most
