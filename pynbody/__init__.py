pynbody
=======

A light-weight, portable, format-transparent analysis framework
for N-body and SPH astrophysical simulations.

For more information, either build the latest documentation included
in our git repository, or view the online version here:

You are strongly recommended to update to python 3.5 or newer. Meanwhile, you can use an older
version of pynbody (prior to version 1.0), by typing:

pip install 'pynbody<1.0'

# for terminal-only applications. However, since pynbody always auto-imported
# pynbody.plot, it would seem to be too destructive to stop this behaviour.
# So this hack is the compromise and should be completely transparent to most
